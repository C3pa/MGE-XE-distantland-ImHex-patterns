# ImHex Pattern files for MGE XE distant land files

These are pattern files to be used with [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/) to inspect [MGE XE](https://github.com/Hrnchamd/MGE-XE) distant land files. These are based on the similar [patterns by Greatness7](https://github.com/Greatness7/binary_templates) for 010 Editor.

## Using

Start ImHex. You'll need to add the folder where you cloned/downloaded this repository to your include paths. To do so, once in ImHex, go to `Extras > Settings > Folders`. Once there add the folder to your list of included folders (this is a one-time process). This will allow ImHex to pick up the correct include paths used in these patterns. 

Now you are ready to open some of the distant land files. Go to `File > Open File...`, and open `Data Files\distantland\world` file. Then you'll get the main view of the hex editor. Then, open the pattern for your file type: `File > Import... > Pattern File`. You'll get a Choose file window. Press `Browse...` and then open the correct pattern file from the folder you cloned/downloaded this repository.
